    <h2>Kylian Ureel</h2>
    <p>
      Wars not make one great. Once you start down the dark path, forever will
      it dominate your destiny, consume you it will. When you look at the dark
      side, careful you must be. For the dark side looks back. Patience you must
      have. Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind. Adventure. Excitement.
      A Jedi craves not these things. Wars not make one great. You must unlearn
      what you have unlearned. You fail because you don’t believe. The dark side
      clouds everything. Impossible to see the future the future is. Adventure.
      Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things. Luminous beings are we, not
      this crude matter. Always pass on what you have learned. Train yourself to
      let go of everything you fear to lose. Patience you must have. Already
      know you that which you need. Your weapons, you will not need them. Always
      two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice. Always pass
      on what you have learned. The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to
      see the future the future is. Fear is the path to the dark side ... fear
      leads to anger ... anger leads to hate…hate leads to suffering. Wars not
      make one great. Already know you that which you need. Your weapons, you
      will not need them. When you look at the dark side, careful you must be.
      For the dark side looks back. Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not
      these things. Much to learn you still have…my old padawan. ... This is
      just the beginning! Once you start down the dark path, forever will it
      dominate your destiny, consume you it will. You must unlearn what you have
      unlearned. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. Much to learn
      you still have…my old padawan. ... This is just the beginning! Difficult
      to see. Always in motion is the future.. You must unlearn what you have
      unlearned. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. Named must be
      your fear before banish it can. Wars not make one great. Hmm. In the end,
      cowards are those who follow the dark side. Your weapons, you will not
      need them. You must unlearn what you have unlearned. Named must be your
      fear before banish it can. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and
      defense, never for attack. Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these
      things. Wars not make one great. Named must be your fear before banish it
      can. Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind. Do. Or do not. There is
      no try. Hmm. In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side.
      Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.. Always two there are,
      no more, no less. A master and an apprentice. You fail because you don’t
      believe.
